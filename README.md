# UnifiedFormControlTheorycrafting

Inspired by [feat(forms): Unified Control State Change Events](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/54579). More context given when running the app.

## Note - see this patched Stackblitz project about why this following "Open in Stackblitz" doesn't work properly. At least when it comes to the console logging of form events lagging out the whole app. 
[Patched Stackblitz I forked that shows that logging the events works in v18 when run with this patch.](https://stackblitz.com/edit/v18-unified-control-state-change-dhiz7f?file=src%2Fmain.ts,README.md). Later I will port over the "Open in Stackblitz" to this little fork. Though I am not sure if the open button will apply the patch, as there seems to be an intermediate process that happens which tweaks the GitHub projects before running on Stackblitz.

[![Open in StackBlitz](https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_stackblitz.svg)](https://stackblitz.com/github/michael-small/unified-form-control-theorycrafting?file=app.component.html)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.3 and then updated to 18.0.0-next.3. Stackblitz may resolve it to a later version.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
